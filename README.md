Source code for the paper Efficient Computation of Hyper-triangles on Hypergraphs

The real-world datasets used in the paper are available: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/

ApproOptimal.cpp corresponding to the algorithm: Appro-adv
CountDenseTTT.cpp corresponding to the algorithm: CountDenseTTT
CountSpareTTT.cpp corresponding to the algorithm: CountSpareTTT
ExactAlgorithm.cpp corresponding to the algorithm: CountTTT   CountTTC   CountTCC   CountCCC  Exact-bs
ParOptimal.cpp corresponding to the algorithm: Par-adv

For the algorithms: Exact-bs, Par-bs, Appro-bs, we simply modify the algorithms: MoCHy-E,  parallelized MoCHy-E, MoCHy-A+, of the paper "Hypergraph Motifs: Concepts, Algorithms, and Discoveries"
